          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>I am Ankitha Vandana. I was born in Ponduru in 2002. My birthday is on 14th of Feb which people celebrate it as Valentines day or celebration of Love . 
            I am single and I hate to be loved or love someone.
            I am currently pursuing my Btech in Gitam University and I belong to the CSE department.
            I did my schooling in KKR gc shcool and my intermediate in Chaitanya college MPC.
            I loved BiPC and dreamt of becomig a Doctor but as people manipulated me I had to go with MPC and thus Engineering.
            If god gives me a chance to go back in time I would pick BIPc and pursue MBBS.
              
          </p>

          <p>Coming to my interests part I like playing Badminton,watching K-dramas.
             I also like to play with the feelings of others. I love getting irritated on them.
             I have one sister and I love her for the obvious reasons.
             Finally,I am an easy to deal girl and less complicated ambivert.
             Contact me on instagram for any suggestions regarding cooking videos available on Youtube.
             I love Abhishek.(which is not true but since I am the one building this website I had to satisfy myself by mentoning this).
             Thank You.
          </p>
